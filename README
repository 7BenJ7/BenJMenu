This plugin can be use for free by everyone. 

It's a simple plugin to have nices main, settings and crÃ©dits menu wich support mouse and gamepad. The base of this plugin is the menus I made for the game Croquettes Gang.

Set up :
1.1 Go to Project Settings
1.2 Set the Game Instance as BP_BenJMenu_GameInstance
1.3 Go yo Engine - Enhanced Input -> Enhanced Input -> User Settings and enable "Enable User Settings"
2.1 Go to plugins
2.2 Enable the "Common UI" plugin 

Enjoy !
